# Outlier tool

## Intro
For multiple hydrological modeling is based on the observed data.
There is not enough words to emphasize the importance and necessity of the observed data.
However, using all the observed data sometimes or frequently decrease precision of the simulation.
For this reason, most of modeling job preprocess outlier step to increase accuracy of the baseline data and model precision.
\n This tool is deveoped on the Cook's distance method to help researchers to conduct the outlier removal efficiently and easily.

## Instruction
1. Input all the data (simulation and observation, do not confuse the column.)
2. Run the source to check the graph.
3. outliered data and graph will be comes out in .csv format in the same directory with the script.

### Preprocess
If you have python(above 3.7) but don't have all the modules or don't know how to, run the 'preprocess.bat' which helps you to download all the modules you need.
